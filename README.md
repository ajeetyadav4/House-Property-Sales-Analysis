In this project, we'll work with data from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/htagholdings/property-sales), the world's largest data science community with powerful tools and resources to help you achieve your data science goals


In this project, we'll use SQL in Jupyter Notebook to explore and analyze data from this database.

### Database: 

The dataset is composed of 5 colums and 29550 row. It includes the following variables:

-**Datesold:** The date when an owner sold the house to a buyer. <br/>
-**Postcode:** 4 digit postcode of the suburb where the owner sold the property. <br/>
-**Price:** Price for which the owner sold the property. <br/>
-**Bedrooms:** Number of bedrooms. <br/>

We are going to find the answers to questions like:

Which date corresponds to the highest number of sales?
Find out the postcode with the highest average price per sale? (Using Aggregate Functions)
Which year witnessed the lowest number of sales?
Use the window function to deduce the top six postcodes by year's price.

## Notes: 

The database being very simple, we could answer complicated questions. This project was intented to practise my SQL skills and show knowledge of simple and more complicated queries using window functions and common table expression(CTE).
